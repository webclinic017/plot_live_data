# plot_live_data

plot_live_data is a project aimed to create a script which can create plots where the data is being drawn live.

## Usage

* The script is designed to read newly written data from a .csv file.

* The script has variables that change the resulting plots.

* Currently, the script is written to plot three line plots with three lines each.

* The data used is a sample data measured from an x-IMU that has 9DOF, 
and a script is written to mimic data being written into a .csv file in real time.

    * To see the example effects, run ``` python tester.py ```
